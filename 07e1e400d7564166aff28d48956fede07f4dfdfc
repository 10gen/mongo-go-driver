      "message": "I feel like this isn\u0027t something that belongs in the cursor implementation. It should be a wrapper around this cursor rather. But as I\u0027m looking at this cursor design and it might be somewhat difficult to compose another cursor with this one, which feels like a problem to me.  I should be able to wrap another implementation of a cursor around this and delegate to it, but I don\u0027t believe that is possible here as I don\u0027t have access to any of the things I\u0027d need to make it happen, specifically current.\n\nMaybe not a big deal, but it means that I can\u0027t create a different cursor for listCollections wrapping around this one.",
