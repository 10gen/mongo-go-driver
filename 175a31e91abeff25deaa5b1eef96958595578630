It increments the transaction number along with each batch. This is how I interpreted the spec with regard to multiple writes (https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/retryable-writes/retryable-writes.rst#executing-retryable-write-commands), but let me know if this needs to be changed.",
