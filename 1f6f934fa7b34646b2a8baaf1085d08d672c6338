So here, instead of making it an if else block, we should have the if check be vr.Type() \u003d\u003d bsontype.Null and put the logic in the else in that block, followed by a continue.\n\nWe also only need to do this for pointer\u0027s specifically, if we have a value we need to pass it on.\n\nYou can look at https://review.gerrithub.io/c/mongodb/mongo-go-driver/+/429291/9/bson/bsoncodec/default_value_decoders.go#806 for reference.",
