This feels really weird to have a boolean in here for a specific type of cursor.\n\nObviously, a list collections cursor has to do something different, for whatever reason. Why does this need to be encoded in the cursor itself as opposed to elsewhere?",

      "message": "Yeah, this felt weird to me as well. The other option was to have another implementation and factor the common code out to helper functions. This might be a little cleaner from the cursor perspective, but as long as we have servers building cursors, the CursorBuilder interface will need to have multiple methods for different types of cursors. I imagine this could be cleaned up when cursors are moved to the driver package and are no longer directly created by servers.",
