      "message": "Ah, I see. Should we add a comment here explaining that as well? Just reading these lines of code, it implies something like: `{ \"a\": 1 {` is okay. Obviously this is not and would be caught by validateToken via advanceState (due to the depth), but a note along the lines of \"allow another key-value pair,OR another top-level object\" could be helpful here.",

      "message": "This was a separate issue that is also fixed. Previously, reading a document a second time, even when only 1 document existed, would result in successfully reading an empty second document due to the nature of how the ExtJSONValueReader functions. Instead of returning ErrEOD, we\u0027ll actually return EOF to signal that the stream is done and no document was found.",
