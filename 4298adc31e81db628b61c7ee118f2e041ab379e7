      "message": "It looks like the latest patch makes TOPOLOGY required and the rest optional.\n\nI still prefer that they all be optional.  I think of it as analogous to starting \u0027mongod\u0027 itself.  If you provide no command line parameters to mongod, it\u0027s a standalone.  You don\u0027t have to say anything like `mongod --standalone`.  In the same way, most developers contributing to the driver will not be changing code that requires testing with a replica set or sharded cluster and are likely to be running a standalone locally.\n\nI also think that in the future we can be friendlier to developers by auto-detecting the cluster type.  Why should we force them to tell us if we can figure it out ourselves?",
