      "message": "This does the manual server selection mentioned here: (https://review.gerrithub.io/c/mongodb/mongo-go-driver/+/418880/9/mongo/client.go#133).  I had to make findServer() public because it does protected reads to find the server so I figured it made sense to reuse this method.  Not sure what kind of error to throw if no server found, so I just did a timeout error since normal server selection would result in a timeout.  Should I make a new one?",
