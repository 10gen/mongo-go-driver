This can\u0027t be centralized in command/read.go because runCommand has different behavior (user-specified operation level read concern overrides what is set in transaction) and we don\u0027t know about runCommand at the command level.",

It says to add this for writeconcern fail/timeout errors - are they all guaranteed to be error code 64?  Also seems for network errors specifically the TransientTransactionError label should not be present?",

      "message": "Here runCommand does *not* override the readpref with transaction readpref.  This implicitly assumes that dispatch.read is only used by runCommand for transactions.  Not sure if this is a good assumption to make, but if not, then that would mean this logic would have to be moved further up into mongo",
