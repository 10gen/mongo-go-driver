      "message": "I didn\u0027t consider the fact that this exposes errors from x. As for a textual representation, I can update the ServerSelectionError.Error() function to included a stringified topology description. Should we still include the actual description.Topology struct in the error? I did this because I assumed tools would need the description for error handling code, but this could be wrong.",
