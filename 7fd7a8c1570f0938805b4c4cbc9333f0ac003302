      "message": "Maybe we can rename MergeClientOptions or refactor to have some of this logic elsewhere? I only say this because the comment above the MergeClientOptions function claims that \"MergeClientOptions combines the given connstring and *ClientOptions into a single *ClientOptions in a last one wins fashion. The given connstring will be used for the default options, which can be overwritten using the given *ClientOptions.\" But it seems this logic is actually happening here in this function.",
