Currently the docs are:\n\n        // KeepAlive specifies the keep-alive period for an active\n        // network connection.\n        // If zero, keep-alives are not enabled. Network protocols\n        // that do not support keep-alives ignore this field.\n        KeepAlive time.Duration // Go 1.3\n\nMy concern is that this will have the effect of disabling keep-alives rather than use the default duration",
