So, TestInsert, TestReadPreference, TestXXX, none of them actually broken and none indicating what the problem is until we inspect them.\n\nIt is best to isolate these into their own methods so that failures don\u0027t necessarily ripple and the test name can tell us more specifically what has happened.",
