      "message": "Nit - is this check necessary? I see below you changed one of the nils in a call to createCollectionStream to an empty Pipeline{}. I know there are a couple other instances of createCollectionStream and createMonitoredStream in this file where pipeline is nil, and I think we should make our tests more consistent - either have nils for all of them and keep this check or empty Pipeline{}\u0027s for all of them and discard it.",

      "message": "We can likely fix this so that it\u0027s much simpler, but I\u0027d rather do that with the tech debt paydown work since this is internal. We don\u0027t currently have a way to create a bsonrw.ValueWriter that can write single values. We can adjust the design to allow this or create a ValueWriter that is in the right mode for writing a single value, but I think we should think about that more in depth rather than do it hastily to reduce the size of this code.",
