      "message": "We can likely fix this so that it\u0027s much simpler, but I\u0027d rather do that with the tech debt paydown work since this is internal. We don\u0027t currently have a way to create a bsonrw.ValueWriter that can write single values. We can adjust the design to allow this or create a ValueWriter that is in the right mode for writing a single value, but I think we should think about that more in depth rather than do it hastily to reduce the size of this code.",
